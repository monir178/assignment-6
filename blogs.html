        1. Difference between var, let and const:
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and
        const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared
        within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const
        variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to
        the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with
        undefined, let and const variables are not initialized. While var and let
        can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized
        during declaration.

        2. Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions:
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do
        they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around
        a single argument to be omitted. Due to arrow functions not defining their own execution context, they're not
        well-suited for usage as methods. However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow functions can be used as
        methods inside classes, if your environment supports it.

    <h1 class="text-danger fw-bold fs-1">3. Filter vs Map vs Find vs Foreach:</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and providing you array elements to do
        operations on them. The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
        executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. Map like filter & foreach
        takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique is it generate a new
        array based on your existing array. The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.
        The find() method executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements
        are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.

    <h1 class="text-danger fw-bold fs-1">4. Why should I Use Template String in JS:</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fw-4 ">
        Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
        variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
        allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with
        template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
        parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
